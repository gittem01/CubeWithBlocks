# CubeWithBlocks

# Required repositories

 - opencv
 - numpy

#

# Possible future improvements

 - Partial block movement via mouse or keyboard (maybe gui)
 - Performance improvements by changing the render library, most probably switching to pygame. Since 3D engine is already established, there is no need for a 3D rendering engine.

#

# Long term ideas

 - Making the cube more than 3x3 blocks (without changing the nxn structure)
 - Computer shuffling and solving the given cube automatically

## Tested in python3.7
